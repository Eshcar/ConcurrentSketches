Big data analytics often needs to answer queries capturing salient properties of large data streams, for example, counting the number of distinct elements in a stream, 
or estimating the median value -- and more generally, quantiles.   
Data sketches are succinct summaries capturing pertinent information from  data streams, in a way that allows answering such queries  bounded error. 
Despite their popularity in today's analytics engines, existing 
implementations are not thread-safe; that is, each sketch object can be accessed  by at most one thread at a time.
In this work we design concurrent sketches that (1) allow queries to be processed while the sketch is being built; and (2) 
support parallel construction of the sketch via multiple threads.
We present a general approach for building concurrent data sketches that
constantly reflect all data processed by multiple update threads, 
and serve queries at any time. We illustrate our approach for  the theta (count distinct) and quantiles sketches. 
Experiments show the algorithms' high performance and scalability in write-only and mixed read-write workloads.
